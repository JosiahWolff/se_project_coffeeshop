# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Each section of page had its own bakcground image or color, I believe that making one background image that can flow with the whole page would look good. Maybe the bakcground colors or image change in between each page for uniqueness.
